This webpage was designed by DiCaruelin for Constitution Day!

Included is an introductory page featuring the Constitution's Preamble and links to individual pages for Articles I - VII, and Amendments 1-27.
Each page has a brief annotation below the text, and a short video explanation which goes into further detail. The only exception to this is Articles I and II, which have separate pages due to the length of these Articles, and thus the inherent length of their explanations.
